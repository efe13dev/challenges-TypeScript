# 🎉 Feast Beast

## 🎯 Challenge Description

All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name.

### 📝 Examples:

- The great blue heron is bringing `garlic naan`
- The chickadee is bringing `chocolate cake`

## 🔍 The Challenge

### ⚠️ Conditions:

- Beast and dish are always lowercase strings
- Each string has at least two letters
- They may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string
- They will not contain numerals
