# Primorial Of a Number

## Definition

Primorial is similar to factorial, but instead of multiplying all natural numbers up to n, only prime numbers are multiplied. It's denoted with P# and represents the product of the first n prime numbers.

## Task

Given a number N, calculate its primorial (P#).

## Notes

- Only positive numbers will be passed (N > 0)

## Examples

### Example 1

```
numPrimorial(3) => 30

Explanation:
For n = 3, multiply the first 3 prime numbers:
2 * 3 * 5 = 30
Written as: P3# = 30
```

### Example 2

```
numPrimorial(5) => 2310

Explanation:
For n = 5, multiply the first 5 prime numbers:
2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310
Written as: P5# = 2310
```

### Example 3

```
numPrimorial(6) => 30030

Explanation:
For n = 6, multiply the first 6 prime numbers:
2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030
Written as: P6# = 30030
```
