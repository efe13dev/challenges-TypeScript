# Suzuki Rake Garden

Help Suzuki rake his garden!

The monastery has a magnificent Zen garden made of white gravel and rocks and it is raked diligently every day by the monks. Suzuki, having a keen eye, is always on the lookout for anything creeping into the garden that must be removed during the daily raking, such as insects or moss.

You will be given a string representing the garden such as:

```ts
garden = 'slug spider rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel';
```

Rake out any items that are not a rock or gravel and replace them with gravel such that:

```ts
garden = 'slug spider rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel';
```

Returns a string with all items except a rock or gravel replaced with gravel:

```ts
garden = 'gravel gravel rock gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel gravel';
```
